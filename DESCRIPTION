Description: The implemented algorithm performs a floating-point genetic algorithm search with a statistical forecasting operator that generates offspring which probably will be generated in future generations. Use of this operator enhances the search capabilities of floating-point genetic algorithms because offspring generated by usual genetic operators rapidly forecasted before performing more generations.
